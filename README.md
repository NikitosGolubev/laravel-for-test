# What is this project?
It's an implementation of the test task, given me when I was applying for a job.
I've fully implemented it plus added extra functionality and styling.
Here's the description: https://github.com/vleukhin/test-laravel-php/blob/master/readme.md

# How long did it take?
So, I had only 1 day to start and complete the project, so my effort was quite intense. It's evident because 14 commits of development were made in a single day.

This is also a reason, why it's **far from my best projects and code-style.** So, don't judge too harshly.

# What did I have to develop?
Basically, a record about a user in Eloquent ORM, with data coming from the html form. But, I've taken it further.
- I've added validations
- I've added the opportunity for the user to manipulate his articles (full CRUD functionality)
- I've added some nice styling (besides the one which was given)
- I've added basic auth-system where users could login, knowing their nickname and logout.
- Added some abstractions on Request classes.

# Summary
All in all, it's an **express-micro project** which I love. Thank you for your attention.
